# Company-Assignment-MeetingRoomBooking
Here at Affle we have a few meeting rooms and more than 150 employees. With this disbalance, setting up a meeting becomes a hassle sometimes. We want to develop a meeting room booking application for our internal use so that employees can book a meeting room without any hassle or clash. 
Requirements:
•	Design a layout using the image given below
•	Upon creating a booking, user should see a calendar event in his Google Calendar (notification not required)
•	Current layout is a single step process, try to break it into two steps.
•	Use React (using Redux will be a plus)
•	Feel free to use any calendar React component.
Fell free to add more meaning functionalities if you feel like.
